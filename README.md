# TwitterSocketStreaming
An exercise in Rails 4 streams + threads, SSEs, Twitter Streaming API, and Redis Pub/Sub.


# About
* A Twitter Streaming API worker runs in a separate thread and publishes JSON serialized tweets via Redis.  
* When a new user logs in via Twitter OAuth, this Streaming thread adds their ID to the following pool and restarts. 
* A logged in client may make a connection using the browser's EventSource class to Server-Sent Events sent by the app server.
* A Redis pub-sub messaging broker mediates the communication between the server-side streaming worker/publisher and the app server (which in turn emits to the client).  
* Basic user data is stored in Redis hashes and z-sets.  Tweets are not stored, but simply pass thru.


# Install & Run
Pull down Redis from your favorite package manager if you don't already have it installed.

Create an app on the [Twitter Developers](https://dev.twitter.com/) website and grant OAuth access 
to your account (needed for the Streaming API).

Clone this repo and update the `config/environment.yml` (included but blank) with your app access info. 

To run if your RAILS_ENV is set to development:

  
     $ bundle install
     # rake rails:update:bin
     $ rails s -p 3000


Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

If your RAILS_ENV=production, you may first need to precompile the assets with:


    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile



# TODO
* Global thread manager
* Write tests
